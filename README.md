truss_ref


Truss_ref is a truss solver for dynamic analisys working with Hilber-Hughes-Taylor method, Newmark method and Central Diference Method.

Natural frequencies should be implemented ant checked using a reference problem. This is being performed in small steps and would be great if someone develop also a modal analisys module.
